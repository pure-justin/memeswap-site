Memeswap TestFlight License Agreement

This app is provided for testing purposes only. By installing or using Memeswap, you agree to the following terms:
	1.	Limited License
You are granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use Memeswap solely for the purpose of testing and providing feedback. Redistribution or commercial use is prohibited.
	2.	Beta Disclaimer
Memeswap is a beta product and may contain bugs, incomplete features, or unstable behavior. We make no guarantees regarding availability, reliability, or functionality. Use is at your own risk.
	3.	Decentralization Notice
Memeswap operates on decentralized infrastructure (e.g., the Hedera network). This means your tokens and wallet interactions are recorded on a public ledger, not managed by a centralized entity. We do not have custody over your assets, tokens, or private keys.
	4.	Private Key Responsibility
You are solely responsible for safeguarding your private keys, seed phrases, and wallet credentials. Loss of access to your wallet may result in permanent loss of funds or tokens. Memeswap cannot recover lost keys or assets under any circumstances.
	5.	User-Generated Content
You are responsible for any token names, symbols, images, or descriptions you create. Offensive, illegal, or misleading content is prohibited and may result in removal or account suspension. Content moderation is aided by AI but final responsibility rests with the user.
	6.	Token Disclaimer
Tokens created in Memeswap are for experimental and community purposes only. They do not represent currency, securities, or investments. Memeswap is not responsible for the value, utility, or tradeability of user-generated tokens.
	7.	HBAR Transfers
HBAR transfers and wallet operations are enabled through the Hedera network. Network fees may apply. All transactions are final, and Memeswap is not liable for transaction errors or failed transfers.
	8.	Data & Privacy
We collect limited data including account IDs, device IDs, and basic usage analytics to improve functionality and prevent abuse. We do not sell personal data. See our Privacy Policy for details.
	9.	Termination
We reserve the right to revoke access to this beta for any reason, including misuse, abuse, or violation of these terms.
	10.	Governing Law & Jurisdiction
This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of Texas. By using this app, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in Travis County, Texas for any legal matters related to this agreement.
